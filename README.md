# Olympic_Data_Analysis

Project Overview
<br>
This project aims to analyze the Olympics dataset sourced from Kaggle using SQL queries. The primary goal is to gain insights into various aspects of the Olympics, including athlete performance, medal distribution, and country participation.

Dataset Description
The dataset obtained from Kaggle contains information about Olympic events, athletes, countries, and medals. It includes data spanning multiple Olympic games and provides details such as athlete names, event types, medal categories, and country representations. The preprocessing steps in preparing the dataset for analysis are detailed in the accompanying SQL scripts.

Dependencies
SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL)

Analysis
Through SQL queries, several questions were explored, including:

Which country has won the most medals in a single Olympic event?
How has the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals evolved?
What are the top-performing sports and athletes in terms of medal count?
The' queries' directory provides the SQL scripts to answer these questions.
