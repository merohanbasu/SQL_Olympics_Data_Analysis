# Olympic_Data_Analysis

## Project Overview <br>
This project aims to analyze the Olympics dataset sourced from Kaggle using SQL queries. The primary goal is to gain insights into various aspects of the Olympics, including athlete performance, medal distribution, and country participation. <br>

## Dataset Description <br>
The dataset obtained from Kaggle contains information about Olympic events, athletes, countries, and medals. It includes data spanning multiple Olympic games and provides details such as athlete names, event types, medal categories, and country representations. The preprocessing steps in preparing the dataset for analysis are detailed in the accompanying SQL scripts. <br>

## Dependencies <br>
SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL) <br>

## Analysis <br>
### Through SQL queries, several questions were explored, including:
1.	How many Olympic games have been held?
2.	List down all Olympic games held so far.
3.	Mention the total no of nations who participated in each Olympic game.
4.	Which year saw the highest and lowest no of countries participating in the Olympics?
5.	Which nation has participated in all of the Olympic games?
6.	Identify the sport that was played in all summer Olympics.
7.	Which Sports were just played only once in the Olympics?
8.	Fetch the total no of sports played in each Olympic games.
9.	Fetch details of the oldest athletes to win a gold medal.
10.	Find the Ratio of male and female athletes who participated in all Olympic games.
11.	Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals.
12.	Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze).
13.	Fetch the top 5 most successful countries in the Olympics. Success is defined by no of medals won.
14.	List down the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country.
15.	List down the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country corresponding to each Olympic game.
16.	Identify which country won the most gold, most silver, and most bronze medals in each Olympic games.
17.	Identify which country won the most gold, most silver, most bronze medals, and the most medals in each Olympic games.
18.	Which countries have never won gold medals but have won silver/bronze medals? <be>

## Instructions
